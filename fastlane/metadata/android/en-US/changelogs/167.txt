Husky v1.0

First stable release. 
This release adds several Pleroma extensions support:
* Emoji reactions
* Formatting posts with Markdown, BBCode or HTML
* Muted conversations
* Stickers
* Extended account properties to see who is your instance moderator or administrator
* Unlimited attachments

Several UI changes include: "Reply to" feature that jumps to replied post, bigger custom emojis by default and, of course, awesome Pleroma-tan artwork made by Lightning_Nord.
