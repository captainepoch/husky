Husky is a fork of [Tusky](https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky) that aimed to support [Pleroma's Mastodon API extensions](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/docs/API/differences_in_mastoapi_responses.md) and some ideas that I may come up with.

Tusky is quote, unquote, `... a beautiful Android client for [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon). Mastodon is an ActivityPub federated social network. That means no single entity controls the whole network, rather, like e-mail, volunteers and organisations operate their own independent servers, users from which can all interact with each other seamlessly.`

## Main changes so far
- Emoji reactions support
- Removed attachment limits for Pleroma
- Support for attaching anything on Pleroma
- Support for changing OAuth application name
- Markdown support with WYSIWYG editor
- Support for extended accounts fields, so you can see who is admin or moderator on your instance
- Subscribing support to annoy you with incoming notification from every post (upstreamed to Tusky)
- Support for seen notifications to less annoy you
- "Reply to" feature that allows to jump to replied status, useful for hellthreading ;)
- Bigger emojis!
- "Preview" feature on Pleroma
